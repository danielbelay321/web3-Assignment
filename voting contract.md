1. Specifies functions for voter registration, proposal creation, voting, delegation, and retrieving the winning proposal ID (```solidity
function registerVoter(address voter) external;
function createProposal(string memory name) external;
function vote(uint256 proposalId) external;
function delegate(address to) external;
function winningProposal() external view returns (uint256 winningProposalId);
).

2. Contract (Voting):

* Inherits from the `IVoting` interface, implementing its functions.
* Uses mappings to store voter information (`voters`) and a list of proposals (`proposals`).
* Defines an `admin` address to control privileged actions (```solidity
mapping(address => Voter) public voters;
Proposal[] public proposals;
address public admin;
```).

3. Functions:

* `registerVoter(address voter)` (admin only): Registers a new voter, setting initial values (```solidity
function registerVoter(address voter) public override onlyAdmin { ... }
).
* `createProposal(string memory name)` (admin only): Creates a new proposal with the specified name (solidity
function createProposal(string memory name) public override onlyAdmin { ... }
).
* `vote(uint256 proposalId)`: Allows a voter to cast a vote for a proposal (checks for eligibility and delegation) (```solidity
function vote(uint256 proposalId) public override { ... }
).
* `delegate(address to)`: Enables a voter to delegate their vote to another registered voter (```solidity
function delegate(address to) public override { ... }
).
* `winningProposal() view`: Publicly retrieves the ID of the proposal with the most votes (doesn't modify contract state) (```solidity
function winningProposal() public view override returns (uint256 winningProposalId) { ... }
).

### Additional Notes:

* The code utilizes modifiers (`onlyAdmin`) to restrict specific actions to the contract administrator.
* The `vote` function handles both direct voting and delegated voting scenarios.
* The `winningProposal` function iterates through all proposals to find the one with the highest vote count.

Overall, this contract provides a foundational framework for a decentralized voting system on the Ethereum blockchain. It offers functionalities for user registration, proposal creation, voting, delegation, and determining the winning proposal.
